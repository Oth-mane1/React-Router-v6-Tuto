React Router is a JavaScript library that helps developers create single-page applications that are responsive and have a dynamic user interface. 
It is a popular tool among React developers and is used to create routing and navigation for web applications.

React Router v6 is a complete rewrite of the previous versions. The biggest difference is that v6 is a static router and does not keep track of any state internally.
This means that v6 is much simpler and easier to use than previous versions.
